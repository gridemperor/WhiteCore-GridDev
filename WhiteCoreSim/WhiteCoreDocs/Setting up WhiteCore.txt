## Readme

If you are using a release, skip down to the next section, otherwise, read on
If you are using the master build, you will need to compile WhiteCore-Sim before you can use it.
  To do this, follow the instructions in Compiling.txt for your system before continuing on with
  this tutorial.


##
## Setting up WhiteCore-Sim
##
  The first thing is to figure out which mode of WhiteCore-Sim you wish to run.
  If you want to run one sim and disallow remote sim connections, you want to run standalone,
      and should jump to the standalone section of this file.
  If you want to run more than one sim and allow remote sim connections, you want to run grid
      mode, and should jump to the grid section of this file.
	  
##
## Standalone Mode
##
  To run WhiteCore-Sim in standalone mode, just run WhiteCore.exe, and enter yes to allow it to 
      configure itself with the inputs from you.
	  
##
## Grid Mode
##
  To run WhiteCore-Sim in grid mode, Uncomment "Include-Single = ServerConfiguration/SingleServerInstance.ini" 
	  in the WhiteCore.Server.ini file, setup the files under ServerConfiguration and then run WhiteCore.Server.exe, 
	  and enter yes to allow it to configure itself with the inputs from you
	  
  Next, you'll start WhiteCore.exe, and enter yes to allow it to configure itself (make sure to set it
      up in grid mode!) with the inputs from you. 
  Your grid is now fully configured, and to restart it, just start the same .exe files as above (without
      re-configuring the grid) in the same order.

## ADVANCED OPTIONS BELOW

##
## Setting up standalone to allow remote connections
##
  To allow standalone WhiteCore.exe to allow remote connections (like grid mode can),
    you'll be doing some major config changes! 
    If you're doing this, you had better have a good reason to!
	YOU WILL NOT GET ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DO THIS.
  In essence, what you have to do is to enable the server handlers for WhiteCore.exe
	which is possible, it's just not very pretty.
	To do this, you'll have to open up Standalone.ini, and find the [Handlers]
	section, and add in 
	
	#START COPYING
	
	LLLoginHandlerPort = 8002 ;;If you want to change this to 8002

    SyncMessagePosterServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    SyncMessagePosterServiceServerHandlerPort = 8014
	SyncMessagePosterServiceDoRemote = true
    InstantMessagingServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    InstantMessagingServiceServerHandlerPort = 8014
    AssetServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    AssetServiceServerHandlerPort = 8010
    AvatarServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    AvatarServiceServerHandlerPort = 8011
    GridServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    GridServiceServerHandlerPort = 8012
    InventoryServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    InventoryServiceServerHandlerPort = 8013
    UserAccountServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    UserAccountServiceServerHandlerPort = 8015
	
	#END COPYING
	
	Then in [WhiteCoreConnectors],
	
	#START COPYING
	
	DoRemoteCalls = False
    AllowRemoteCalls = True
	
	#END COPYING
	
  This enables all of the remote listening handlers, so that other WhiteCore.exe 
	instances can connect to WhiteCore.exe as if it were WhiteCore.Server.exe
	
##
## Running a grid of standalone WhiteCore.exe services all with one database
##

This is possible... if you can do it, congratulations, you know the configs 
  and how they interact with WhiteCore very well!

##
## Running a region on WhiteCore.Server.exe
##

This too is possible, and if you can do it, congratulations, just like above.

##
## Tips on speeding up closed grids
##
	
1: Disable remote services for WhiteCore.exe in grid mode
    EG. Disabling the remote asset connector, and just have it directly
	    access the database, so that WhiteCore.Server isn't as necessary.
