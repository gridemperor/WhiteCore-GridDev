The CSV file needs to be in the Data/Updates folder and can have any name but suggested name is users.csv

File build up:

UUID,First Name, Last Name, Password, Emailaddress

Make sure when there's no Emailaddress that you put none in that field

The CSV file will be in the Data/Updates folder and passwords are not being saved with them (as of this moment)
