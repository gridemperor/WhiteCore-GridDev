WhiteCore configuration options
===============================

To tailor the standard WhiteCore configuration to you own personal setup,
modify the following configuration files..

For the standard 'Standalone' configuration

Directory: Config/Sim
*********
	
 /Data/MySql.ini :	Change the MySql connection details to your setup - This is for the Simulator services
					 
 					ConnectionString = "Data Source=127.0.0.1;Port=3306;Database=<whitecore databasename>;User ID=<database user>;Password=<user password>;"
   
   <whitecore databasename> :  The database name that you have created 
   <database user>			:  The user that has permission to access the <whitecore databasename>
   <user password>			:  The password for the whitecore user

								  
 
 /Standalone/GridInfoService.ini : Change the grid name and nickname
	        gridname = "WhiteCore Sim Sandbox"
            gridnick = "WhiteCoreSim"
 		   
 /Standalone/StandaloneCommon.ini : Change the welcome message sent to the viewer on login
 			WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to the WhiteCore Sim Sandbox, <USERNAME>!"
 
 /WhiteCore.ini : 
 	If your viewer stalls on login You may need to specify the internal_ip
			internal_ip = "127.0.0.1"
	To use the external address of your system, comment thie hostname entry out
 			Add comment ';' -> ;HostName = 127.0.0.1 
			
			
			
Grid Mode setup
===============

To change to a grid mode setup, modify the following...

Directory:  Config/Grid/ServerConfiguration
**********

 /Data/MySql.ini :	Change the MySql connection details to your setup 
 					- This is for the grid services and normally is the same as per the Simulator service configuration
					If required, it can be different.
 					
					ConnectionString = "Data Source=127.0.0.1;Port=3306;Database=<whitecore databasename>;User ID=<database user>;Password=<user password>;"
   
   <whitecore databasename> :  The database name that you have created 
   <database user>			:  The user that has permission to access the <whitecore databasename>
   <user password>			:  The password for the whitecore user

/GridInfoService.ini : Change the grid name and nickname
    gridname = "WhiteCore Sim Sandbox"
    gridnick = "WhiteCoreSim"
	
/Login.ini : The welcome message sent to a viewer on login
    WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to the WhiteCore Sim Sandbox, <USERNAME>!"


You need to change the simulator setup from Standalone to grid mode
 
Directory: Config/Sim
*********

  /Main.ini : change includes from Standalone to Grid mode
	    	Add comment    ';' ->	 ;Include-Standalone = Configuration/Standalone/StandaloneCommon.ini
			Remove comment ';' ->    Include-Grid = Configuration/Grid/WhiteCoreGridCommon.ini

 /Grid/GridCommon.ini :  If you are not running the Grid services on the same system as the simulator, you
 								  will need to change the Address of where to find the GridServerURI.
								  (Please leave the port as 8012)
						
						e.g.	  [Configuration]
								      GridServerURI = "http://127.0.0.1:8012/grid/"
