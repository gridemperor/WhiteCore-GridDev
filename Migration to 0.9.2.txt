Migrating your data and configuration to 0.9.2
----------------------------------------------

 * What has happened? *
 
 To make updating the binary code of WhiteCore, the decision was made to restructure where 
 various parts are stored in a running instance.
 Historically (OpenSim & Aurora) a lot of data was stored in the "bin" directory, because 
 this was a known location and I guess it was very convenient. 
 
 This was fine until an update of the binary code was available or desired.
 This update meant carefully copying or cut/pasting various files which contained the data
 and configuration of the simulator.
 
 This is the reason for the change... to make it easier..  
  - to save your data and configuration
  - to update to a newer version
  
  ( Note:  This is a work in progress so all options may not yet be covered )
  
* The layout *

All necessary files for running an instance of WhiteCore are contained in the
 "WhiteCoreSim" directory.  This directory can be copied to your desired location and
 your simulator run. 
  For grid operations, you can run multiple instances of WhiteCore by duplicating this
 directory, configuring to your requirements and running.  Each instance will have it's
 own configurations and data, separate form other instances.  (This does depend on your
 choice of data storage and if you use MySql or variants, some of your data will be 
 stored externally... but then you can have multiple databases... can't you :)  )
 
 
* Migrating your configuration *

The configuration files are the same as for previous version of WhiteCore, just that they
 are now in a different location.  
 Note: There are some significant differences in the "Includes" directive and these should
 not be altered.
 
 You can find all the configuration files in  "WhiteCoreSim/Config"
 - The Sim directory is for a Standalone configuration
 - The Grid directory if for a Grid server configuration
 
 To move your configuration to the new structure you will need to transfer your current
 customized settings over to the same "ini" file in the new locations for both the "Grid"
 and "Sim" directories.
 i.e Copy your old "WhiteCore.ini" settings to the new "WhiteCore.ini" file, remembering
 that you only need to copy across your modifications.
 The old "configuration" directory correspondes to the new "Sim" directory.
 The old "ServerConfiguration" directory is now in the new "Grid" directory
 
 The only exception to this is the main "ini" file for a standalone (region) or grid setup 
 with the main configuration files in the "WhiteCoreSim/Config" directory. 
 This is either...
 - "WhiteCore.ini for a standalone or region instance
 - "WhiteCore.Server.ini" for a Grid server instance.
 
 There is now an additional configuration file, "MyWorld.ini" which contains some basic user
 settings that will override the defaults or other configuration files.
 
 For a very quick installation, edit this "MyWorld.ini", change the name and 
 hostname (if desired) and run.  The default configuration will use an SQLite database
 and is preconfigured to run "As is"  
    (Sorry Linux users, the SQLite library still has problems here but you would have been
    using something else anyway, wouldn't you? :)  )
    
    
* Migrating your data *

If you have not already modified your configuration to save your region data files externally
 to the "bin" directory, you will need to find and copy/move all '*.sim" files to...
   bin/*.sim  ==>>  WhiteCoreSim/Data/Region/*.sim
   
If you are using SQLite as your data store, copy all existing ".db" files to...
   bin/*.db  ==>>  WhiteCoreSim/Data/SQLite/*.db
  
For MySql, no migration will be necessary other than to ensure the configuration has been
 entered appropriately.
 
For Filebased data, it is suggested that you copy your existing file cache directory into the
WhiteCoreSim/Data directory and modify your configuration appropriately.  This will then
adhere to the "single directory per instance" structure.  
   
The existing bin/assetcache and bin/ScriptEngine cache files may safely be ignored as they
 will be re-created when your new instance is run for the first time.  
 This does include map tiles etc.
  
##  If you have any other data that I may have missed, please let me know or log an issue
     on the WhiteCoreSim Github or whitecore-sim.org site so that it may be corrected.
